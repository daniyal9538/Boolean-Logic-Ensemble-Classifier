# Boolean-Logic-Ensemble-Classifier
Implementing Hierarchical Categories with a Novel Boolean Logic Ensemble Classifier to Overcome Dataset Limitations

Dependencies: Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, treelib, pickle, matplotlib

categoryTree.py: Contains the cuisine category tree as described in the article linked below


trainClassifier.py: Functions to train and save the classifiers. Dataset should be in a .csv file with the following column headings:

Dish Name | Level 1 | Level 2| ...... | Level n


classificationFunctions.py: Functions to load classifiers and get predictions from the system describe in the article linked below.

I cannot upload the dataset that the system was trained on because it belongs to a client.
